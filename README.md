# Remy-Hair-Extensions-10-Things-to-Consider-Before-Buying

Following in the steps of celebrity actresses, models and media personalities, ever increasing numbers of women are discovering the benefits of Remy hair extensions and Remy weaves over other grades of human and synthetic hair. As with other popular new products and services, the international market is now flooded with many brands of hair extensions and hair weave options. For those considering buying Remy hair extensions and Remy hair weaves for the first time, below is a list of considerations before purchasing your Remy hair.

1. Know your product

Remy hair is superior to synthetic hair and other types of human hair extensions for 5 reasons: Natural lustre and shine, softness, strength and longevity. Remy hair's superiority is due to the fact that the hair shaft is cuticle aligned i.e. All the hair is laying in the same direction. Cuticle aligned hair reflects light in a particular way, is easier to maintain and style and is prone to less tangling and matting.

2. Ensure your own hair is in good condition

It has been well documented that the continuous use of hair extensions can cause damage to your own hair, scalp and hair follicles. It is vitally important that you ensure that your hair and scalp are in good condition before proceeding to choose to add Remy hair extensions, weaves, pre-bonded tips or clip-ins. If you are using the sew-in method of attachment then ensure that your own hair is healthy strong and more than 2" in length. Ensure that in any one 6 month period that you give your own hair and scalp a rest by removing all sew in weaves for at least a 2 week period. If your choice of attachment is bonding then ensure that your hair is not thinning and is more than 3" in length before proceeding to have them attached. As with sew-in weaves, if you are considering using pre-bonded tips for an extended amount of time, you should also consider giving your own hair a rest periodically.

3. Choose a length that is right for you

Regardless of celebrity fashions or what hair style gurus or the latest style magazines are stating, the best way to choose a length that is right for you is to take a long hard look at yourself and decipher exactly what style works best for your height, body type and face shape.

4. Choose a style wisely

As above, choosing your style is a very personal matter and one that should involve taking an audit of your lifestyle, your tastes, aspirations and profession. While fashion is ever-changing the best form of style is one that is unique and individual. Again, when choosing a style to adopt take account of your height, body-type, face shape, skin colouring and eye-colouring.

5. Know your Remy qualities

It takes care and practice to tell one true Remy extension product from a 'human-hair' product masquerading as Remy extensions. But with a little practice and a few guidelines you will be able to avoid falling foul of charlatan distributors.

Firstly, Remy hair is very soft to the touch, it feels fluid and runs through your fingers like water. It has a high lustre and shine but does not look waxy (a typical tell tale sign of synthetic hair).

Secondly, Remy hair falls into 2 main categories: Virgin (non-coloured and non-processed) Remy and Non-Virgin (coloured and/or processed) Remy hair.

Virgin Remy Extensions

Depending on the donor of the hair, Virgin Remy extensions can be straight, wavy or curly. Virgin Remy hair extensions are now supplied from all over the world including Europe, China, Malaysia and Brazil but the vast majority of Virgin Remy hair is sourced from India. Depending on where the hair is sourced you will find that the hair has differing characteristics due to ethnic differences of each region.

Non-Virgin Remy Extensions

Non-Virgin Remy Hair can be either simply coloured or it can also be processed to include an array of different wavy or curly textures including the Yaki texture, Body Wave texture, Deep Wave texture etc.

Hair Ratio

Another key to ensuring value for money is understanding what hair ratio you are purchasing. Remy extensions can be single drawn - where the hair is of varying lengths, or double drawn - where all the hair is more or less the same length. With double drawn hair the effect is hair that has increased body and looks fuller. However, it is worth noting that if your final hair style is a feathered or layered look, purchasing a single drawn Remy Hair may be appropriate and cost effective.

6. Choosing your supplier wisely

With the explosion in demand for Remy hair extensions there has also been an explosion in suppliers claiming they are supplying authentic Remy hair. As Remy hair extension are top of the range hair extensions (demanding top of the range prices) then you should ensure you become familiar with how Remy extensions look, feel to the touch and reacts when you brush it. If it is Virgin Remy that is your choice of hair extension then you should be aware of how scarcity might affect the price. For example, if you want a 20" copper/red spiral curl or 24" honey blonde deep wave curl these types of Remy will be supplied from either Brazil or Europe and will therefore be more expensive than the more widely available 16" dark brown straight Virgin Remy supplied from India, China or Malaysia. In short, educate yourself about the various types of Remy and their availability, scarcity and subsequent price points.

7. Choosing your application method - clip-ins, sew in wefts or pre-bonded tips

Your application method will be dependent upon your lifestyle and styling requirements. If, for example, you are simply looking for temporary styling solutions that provide additional length, thickness or a flash of colour and your hair is already more than 5" long then simple clip-in hair could be the solution. If, however, you are seeking a more permanent solution that can be kept for a number of months then a sewn-in weft or pre-bonded tips may be the better option.

8. Choosing your stylist wisely

Once you have chosen your style, colour and application method, choosing a professional and experienced hair stylist is a critical to maintaining beautiful Remy hair extension. Apart from clip-in Remy extensions which may be applied at home, it is essential that the stylist you choose is concerned with not only the application of your Remy extensions or weaves but the maintenance and health of your hair and the removal or replacement of your extensions at the appropriate time. A good stylist not only applies the extensions but is able to further customise them into a unique personal look.

9. Caring for your Remy extensions and replacing them

Your Remy extensions will need to be taken care of in order to maintain their good looks. Caring for your Remy extensions should include, gentle combing or brushing on a daily basis, wrapping or plaiting, washing and conditioning. The use of heated appliances should be undertaken with care and your used only occasionally.

10. A Final Word

Remy hair extensions have become popular because of the exceptional looks and styles that can be obtained and the longevity of the product. While being somewhat more expensive than other human hair products and substantially more expensive than synthetic products, if maintained Remy hair extensions will last substantially longer than other extensions and offer a cost effective hair solutions and wise beauty investment.
